Acting Like a Child

As I started this project, I knew that I wanted to use a poem that I wrote, called “Acting Like a Child”, and set my soundscape at a playground to remind listeners of the days of blissful recess times of playing tag in mulch and  jump-roping, and to contrast this childhood scene with the way that we view children as we ourselves mature. 

I hope that as you listen to my soundscape - the responses of people, the yelling and laughter of children, other
typical playground sounds, and then the verses of my poem - that you consider your own opinions
on children, and how, perhaps, being childlike may not be the opposite of being worthy, dignified,
and valuable. 


Where can you find more information? How do you listen to the Soundscape? 

To see details on the sources I used, see SOURCES.md for an organized citation list, and ASSETS.md for a play-by-play of
how I came upon using each of the assets. 

To understand a bit more of the process of making the soundscape, and the reasoning behind the sounds or layering of them, see reflection.md. 

To see some work-in-progress information, see What_is_in_my_soundscape.md, which an earlier description of initial
sounds added. Some in-progress screenshots are here too, soundscape_01222019 and soundscape_01252019.

For instructions on how to listen to the soundscape (especially if you're unfamiliar with git or github), go to 
the ABOUT.md file. 

The soundscape itself was made using Audacity, and the project file from there is called 
Acting_like_a_child_project.aup.

Thanks for listening! Enjoy.
