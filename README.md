Acting Like a Child

As I started this project, I knew that I wanted to use a poem that I wrote, called “Acting Like a Child”, and set my soundscape at a playground to remind listeners of the days of blissful recess times of playing tag in mulch and  jump-roping, and to contrast this childhood scene with the way that we view children as we ourselves mature. 

I hope that as you listen to my soundscape - the responses of people, the yelling and laughter of children, other
typical playground sounds, and then the verses of my poem - that you consider your own opinions
on children, and how, perhaps, being childlike may not be the opposite of being worthy, dignified,
and valuable. 

To see details on the sources I used, see SOURCES.md for an organized citation list, and ASSETS.md for a play-by-play of
how I came upon using each of the assets. 

To understand a bit more of the process of making the soundscape, and the reasoning behind the sounds or layering of them, see REFLECTION.md.
