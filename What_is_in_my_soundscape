In my initial preview soundscape (for 1/24/18), I have combined three seperate sounds - two of my own recording, and one from YouTube.

First, I searched for ambient 'playground' sounds, and found a great track on YouTube, which I intend to use large portions of. 
Thanks to Ambience Background Noise - Kinder Spielplatz Ger√§usche SOUND for this addition to my soundscape!!
I haven't edited this track much at all yet, except for deleting parts of the clip that were more white-noise, and wouldn't help the listener 
know that they were at a playground. I tried to highlight (as in, reduce other sounds, or take pauses in the people speaking) children yelling, 
and other key features of this ambient track that would help set the scene.

Ben recommended that I could use some music in the background as well, as another layer. I'm debating between a few songs, but one that came to mind is 
"Psalm 126", and I'll have to see if I'm allowed to use this. Other songs could be more hymns, but just the piano versions, so to highlight the dignity of children,
perhaps especially during the more somber parts of my poem.

After uploading the ambiet playground noise, I recorded myself saying my poem, taking out parts
where I messed up and using the "noise cancellation" feature on Audacity to reduce unwanted sounds. 

I learned how to use the Split command to help insert stanzas of the poem at certain points of the ambient background noise.
(which, I realized, is something that needs a highlighted portion of the recording as an input, not after you've already selected
the effect to use).

Lastly, I asked my housemate to answer a question (which I intend to ask about 5-10 others) and recorded her response, 
trying to fit it into the introductory portion of the background ambient playground noise. I'll wait to add other responses until I get more 
throughout the week!


To do: pick songs, get gym-related recordings, and ask question of at least 3 more people this week.
