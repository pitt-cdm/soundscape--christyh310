1) Playground noises

Thank you to Ambience Background Noise - Kinder Spielplatz Ger√§usche SOUND for the playground sounds!
To properly give credit here, I was required to 'like' their page and give credit to them here, and
I can also add verbal acknowledgement at the end of my soundscape as well. 

2) Puddles
from youtube audio library, under CC liscense, free to use
https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/soundeffects
I found the specific sound under "walking in a mud puddle sound effect"

3) Rivers and Roads, by The Head and the Heart
I will use this asset under fair use, for the following reasons:
First, the purpose of the use is for nonprofit and educational pruposes. I am using this to better understand how to 
implement sounds to create a narrative and to understand how Audacity works. 
Secondly, this work is pubslished by a well-known band, The Head and the Heart. 
Third, I am using a small non-lyrical portion of the song in my soundscape.
I will be using the introductory <30 seconds of 'oohs'. I used the soundclip multiple times in my soundscape,
so this music plays for longer than thirty seconds, but that's because of the copy/paste I used to extend the time. 
Lastly, the my re-use will not affect the market value or sales of the original song because I'm using this only for
educational pruposes and I do not intend on using this soundscape for profit. It will only be listened to by me, my
professor, and classmates. 

4) 4 responses to question: I asked them all before recording their voice, and I actually used my own voice
to say one of their responses, because even after much manipulation, I was unable to make the response sound
clear / unmuddied, so I just took her response and recorded my own voice in a much more quiet room

5) Rain
In the video information section, it said to link to the YouTube channel "Free Sound Library" so here's 
the link to their whole channel. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTdyXszrxhMP-pbhy85Pa-g

Here is the link to the specific sound used:

6) shade sound was recorded by Ben, and he gave it freely to us to use for this project

All of my other assets were personally recorded, and are included in the "assets" page,
so will not be included here.
