1) Playground noises

Thank you to Ambience Background Noise - Kinder Spielplatz Ger√§usche SOUND for the playground sounds!
To properly give credit here, I was required to 'like' their page and give credit to them here, and
I can also add verbal acknowledgement at the end of my soundscape as well. 

2) Puddles
from youtube audio library, under CC liscense, free to use

I found the specific sound under "walking in a mud puddle sound effect"

3) Rivers and Roads, by The Head and the Heart
Because I am using the introductory 15-25 seconds of 'oohs', not the lyrics of this song, and because I'm 
only using this for educational purposes, and not claiming it as my own, I feel that it is ok to use this 
song, at least this portion. I used the soundclip multiple times in my soundscape, so this music plays for
longer than thirty seconds, but that's because of the copy/paste I used to extend the time. 

4) 4 responses to question: I asked them all before recording their voice, and I actually used my own voice
to say one of their responses, because even after much manipulation, I was unable to make the response sound
clear / unmuddied, so I just took her response and recorded my own voice in a much more quiet room

5) Rain
In the video information section, it said to link to the YouTube channel "Free Sound Library" so here's 
the link to their whole channel. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTdyXszrxhMP-pbhy85Pa-g

Here is the link to the specific sound used:

6) shade sound was recorded by Ben, and he gave it freely to us to use for this project

All of my other assets were personally recorded, and are included in the "assets" page,
so will not be included here.
